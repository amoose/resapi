resapi
=========

/ˈresəˌpē/

Cooking up APIs in minutes from various data sources.

  - Quickly create an API from a file or other API.
  - Instantly begin querying and searching your API. 
  - Launch your own instance! Pull down the repo, spin up EC2 and go nuts!

Inspired by [DataBeam](https://github.com/philipashlock/DataBeam) and the [Presidential Innovation Fellows](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows).

## The Plan
  - Accept various types files
  - Setup resque for background consumption of data sources with instant status
  - Allow update of frequency
  - Uploads or consume endpoints
  - 100% test coverage
  - Scraping websites?
